# Ascent-ML-Hackathon-
This project uses a PyTorch-based EDSR model for Super-Resolution (SR) image enhancement. It trains on LR/HR image patches, performs inference with tiling, and evaluates results using PSNR/SSIM metrics against a bicubic baseline. The aim is to achieve high-quality upscaling of low-resolution images.
